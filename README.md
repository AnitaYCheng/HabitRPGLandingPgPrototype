New landing page for HabitRPG
======================
## May 2015 update
Having trouble installing a local install of HabitRPG to test this, so need some help!

**Statichome.html** is the file that needs to be converted and merged into the front.jade file [here](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg/tree/develop/website/views/static) 

**Staticstyle.css** is the file that goes [here](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitrpg/tree/develop/website/public/front)


## Scrolling animations (for later!)
I’ve included a wireframe that shows the interactions I’m looking for. There are also comments in the HTML file, and **home.html** is the HTML test I’m using for scrolling.

@lefnire suggests [Skrollr](https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr)
